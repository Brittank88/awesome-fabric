# Contribution Guidelines
## Eligibility
A project is eligible to be added to this list if it is:
- **awesome** :sunglasses:
> Research if the stuff you're including is actually awesome. Only put stuff on the list that you or another contributor can personally recommend. You should rather leave stuff out than include too much.
- well documented (wiki, javadocs or command line help)
- maintained (no dead projects)

## Adding a new entry to the list

1. Make sure the entry is [eligible](#eligibility) for this list.
2. Click on the pen icon at the top of the README file.
3. Add the entry at the alphabetically right position. It should follow the convention:
```

```
4. At the bottom of the page state what you added.
5. Propose the changes and open a pull request.
